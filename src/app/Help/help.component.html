The Idea of this app is to let users evaluate item price data in Eve.
First pick a couple of Regions to monitor.
Second pick some items. 


The Price board is there for users to view price data for each item currently listed. Sell orders are only monitored.

I fixed a number of recent issues. Price formatting etc...
